101,What is Kubernetes?,kubernetes is an open source container orchestration framework which was originally developed by google so on the foundation it manages containers be docker containers or from some other technology which basically means that kubernetes helps you manage applications that are made up of hundreds or maybe thousands of containers and it helps you manage them in different environments like physical machines virtual machines or cloud environments or even hybrid deployment environments,64,98

101,What is the job of scheduler in Kubernetes?,scheduler which is basically responsible for scheduling containers on different nodes based on the workload and the available server resources on each node so it's an intelligent process that decides on which worker node the next container should be scheduled on based on the available resources on those worker notes and the load that that container meets,336,360
