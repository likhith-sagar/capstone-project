102,waterfall model,399,402,prototypes are built with dummy functionalities this is a useful tool for figuring out what the customer actually wants let's take a look at the cycle to obtain useful user feedback software prototypes are created before the final product after taking into account user feedback the prototype is once more examined by the client up until the consumer accepts the model this process continues after gathering requirements a rapid design is made and a prototype is developed before being delivered to the customer for review the prototype is modified in response to client comments and the clarified requirement then represented to the client for review the customer must accept the prototype before the genuine program can be developed the waterfall model approach,698,746,103 205 104

104,port 80 and 443,34,42,"port 80 and 443 which are used for web pages.  Port number 21 is used for FTP.  And port number 25 is used for email.  A port number is always associated with an IP address.  An IP address is a numeric address. It's an identifier for a computer or device on a network.  Every device has to have an IP address for communication purposes. And an IP address and a port number work together to exchange data on a network. So for example if you want to connect to a server over the internet, the IP address is used to determine the geographical location of that server.  Such as what continent, country, city, and so on.  And a port number determines which service or program on that server it wants to use. Whether that service or program is a web page, FTP service, email, and so on. Now in simple terms, what does this all mean?  So as an example, let's take a very common port that just about everyone uses every day and that is port number 80. Port 80",34,111,405 401 207
