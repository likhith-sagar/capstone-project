204,structured data relational semi-structured unstructured,94,97,structured data relational semi-structured unstructured we have so many types of different data so we have a big requirement we have where we have different type of data as per the different use cases and we have to accumulate and we have to work on that data next is velocity so what is it basically it means that like we require there are some special cases of data that we need in real time like we can't even expect a delay of that single second so like for example in every 60 seconds we have more than 100 000 plus tweets which is getting available in every 60 seconds we have 1800 TB of data which is being stored so we need them need a solution which can be very fast like the moment you're going to hit that data is stored updated and the result is being presented to you so we need a basically a very super fast way that's something we manage uh here with the help of velocity,94,143,106 203 401

203,increases the complexity of the problem,163,165,increases the complexity of the problem an example is Uber might collect information like the location of restaurants and cafes nearby now such data is not needed to analyze Uber search pricing therefore such data has to be removed at this step data cleaning is followed by data exploration and Analysis the data exploration stage is like the brain storming of data analysis this is where you understand the patterns in your data this is followed by data modeling the data modeling stage basically includes building a machine learning model that predicts the Uber search at a given time and location this model is built by using all the insights and Trends collected in the exploration stage the model is trained by feeding a thousands of customer records so that it can learn to predict the outcome more precisely next is the data validation,163,214,204 106 401
106,the precursor to the object,289,295,structures allow the programmer to store data of different types together for instance whereas an array would allow you to store only int or only strings using a structure you could store int and strings together along with other data types a structure can even store other structures within it a structure can be very useful in the earlier chess example because you could store all of the useful pieces of data related to the knight in one structure that represents that knight you could then store your knight structures together in one structure that represents all of the knights and so on the structure allowed such grouping to take place beyond what arrays were capable of the structure is in many ways the precursor to the object,246,295,204 407 401
