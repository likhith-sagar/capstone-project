401,performs two types of services connection oriented transmission,487,491,performs two types of services connection oriented transmission and connectionless transmission connection oriented transmission is done via tcp while connectionless transmission is done via udp odp is faster than tcp because it does not provide any feedback whether data was really delivered whereas tcp provides a feedback therefore lost data can be retransmitted,487,512,405
