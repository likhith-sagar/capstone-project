405,slows down the data transfer rate,1035,1039,slows down the data transfer rate in this way tcp handles congestion throttling or flow control the last phase in the data transmission is connection termination when an endpoint wishes to stop its connection it sends a finished message to the other end point the other end point acknowledges the message both ends do this two-phase handshake process therefore the connection termination follows a four-way handshake process so this is the way how tcp handles data transfer now the topmost layer in the tcp ip protocol suite is the application layer,1035,1077,
405,udp does not support segmentation,785,788,udp does not support segmentation so the applications using udp should send messages short enough to fit into one udp datagram note that the data unit in tcp is called tcp segment and the data unit in udp is called udp datagram udp datagrams are considered unreliable because there is no guarantee that all datagrams sent will be received in the destination and in the correct order so if reliability is needed udb should not be used udp lacks error checking and correction it makes udp fast and efficient for dns dhcp snmp and rip protocols udp is also suited for streaming videos tcp on the other hand is reliable and guarantees in-order delivery of data from the sender to the receiver,785,835,401

So, within a process there may be  one or more units of its execution and those units are known as threads. And again in earlier systems, one process had only thread. But now a single process has many threads  or many units of execution within it. So, a process can have anywhere from  one thread to many threads.",202,237,

407,compile your program,73,77,"processes and threads. So, in this lecture we will be trying  to get an introductory idea and understanding of what  are processes and threads. And usually people are confused many  times between the processes and threads. So, we will try to understand what these  are and what are their differences. So, first of all before we understand processes, let us first try to understand  how a program is developed. So, whenever you want  to make a program, what you do is, you first write the program in  some high level languages. For example, let's say you  write the program in C, C++, JAVA or something like that. And that program is written  in a high level language. Now, we know at the basic level computer does not understand  the high level language. But it understands only the binary  codes, which are 0's and 1's. So, the program has to be  converted to binary code. So, for that using a compiler, you  compile your program",17,77,202 106
