It is generally recommended that we first break down the problem into different sub parts solve them individually and then finally combine them to get the desired result. This is how the machine learning algorithm handles the L'm on the other hand the Deep learning algorithm solves the problem from end to end. Let's take an example to understand this suppose. You have a task of multiple object detection. And your task is to identify. What is the object and where it is present in the image. So, let's see and compare. How will you tackle this issue using the concept of machine learning and deep learning",639,677,

The next queue that we have is known as the 'ready queue'. The processes that are residing in the main memory, and are ready and waiting to execute are kept on a list called the ready queue. So, in ready queue we have those processes, which are ready and waiting to be executed. So, these are the processes that are residing in the main memory and they are ready to be executed. They are just waiting to get the CPU, so that they can start executing. So, job queue is the list of all the processes that we have",367,421,
