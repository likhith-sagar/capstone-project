The problem was how to train more robust version of AI system while in the case of Neuroscience problem faced by the researchers was how to design operation model of the brain. So these are some of the issues which had the largest influence and led to the existence of the machine learning. Now this machine learning shifted its focus from the symbolic approaches.

404,ipsec,197,200,a popular site-to-site vpn is ipsec,193,200,
404,remote access,400,404,remote access vpns tls is the same security protocol used to encrypt your web traffic when connecting to https sites it's also handy because some public wi-fi might block ipsec ports whereas tls usually uses well-known port 443 which is generally allowed when configuring remote access,400,425,
404,a router or a firewall on both sites,190,197,one device for example a user's laptop in a coffee shop this is unlike the site-to-site vpn which connects to entire networks okay so now we know what a vpn is and the two different types let's look at each in a bit more detail first let's start with site-to-site vpns here we have site a and site b both sites are connected to the public internet site-to-site vpns are typically configured on either a router or a firewall on both sites,158,197,
404,allows several protocols to be used for each vpn feature ipsec is often used for site-to-site vpns but it can also be used for remote access vpns as well once the vpn is established all devices on each site can send data securely over the vpn so how does this work well let's say a host from site a sends some data over to site b the router will look at this data see that it's destined for site b and realize it needs to send this over the vpn before it can send it over the vpn though it first needs to encrypt the data,207,250,does not define any one way to create a vpn but rather allows several protocols to be used for each vpn feature ipsec is often used for site-to-site vpns but it can also be used for remote access vpns as well once the vpn is established all devices on each site can send data securely over the vpn so how does this work well let's say a host from site a sends some data over to site b the router will look at this data see that it's destined for site b and realize it needs to send this over the vpn before it can send it over the vpn though it first needs to encrypt the data,204,250,

405,tcp slows down the data transfer rate,1035,1039,congestion throttling or flow control the goal for tcp is to send segments to the receiving end as fast as possible without losing them when tcp first sends the segment it sets a timer if the segments are acknowledged before the timer expires the tcp increases the transmission speed until the segments begin to become unacknowledged since the acknowledgement for some segments is not received within the time the sending tcp module retransmits the segments when a significant number of packets have to be retransmitted tcp slows down the data transfer rate,1003,1039,
