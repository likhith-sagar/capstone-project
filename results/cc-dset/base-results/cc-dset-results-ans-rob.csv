So initially it may not have a network communicate. So in such case it is not reaching the server itself. Or the request may be reached the server but the server is not available, the node is not responding or otherwise the server has responded but. Because of the game, the network unavailability it does not reach to the client. So there are multiple things that may go wrong with respect to a request that is given by a client. So what we have to infer so that there is there is some parts of a system that may be broken and some parts of the system may be walking. So in such case we call that as a partial failure and the difficulty is the partial failures are non deterministic. In this sense, they work or they behave differently.

So in such case we have seen that there is a usage of pi modes so that the resources are not used indefinitely. So here the timeout interval also has to be defined appropriately. So it has to be experimented and then it has to be. Fine. Say for example if the client is waiting for the recommendation for three seconds and the recommendation is waiting for the relevance for two seconds and the relevance in turn is waiting for the promotion for five seconds. So if the response is not received then in that case the client has to wait for a total of ten seconds obviously. So this has to be taken care and while setting the timeout it has to be practically experiment and then it defines a proper time interval and if there is a variability. In the delay then it has to adjust with whatever the delay and then define the timeout interval and next is the retransmission of the data.

A cloud service provider is a third party company offering the cloud based platform, infrastructure, application or storage services. A third party vendor is defined as an entity that enters into a partnership or relationship with an organization. Where the vendor may be accessing, sharing, or leveraging an organization's 's protected data Common examples of third party on cloud are services such as Google, which we use in our day-to-day life. The primary method of ensuring that a contract exists between the subcontractor and its implementation arises due to the fact that most businesses are going online today. Amir, signing of contract is not sufficient as adequate monitoring of the implementation is also required. Few of the details that need to be considered are due diligence. An enterprise should define the scope of the cloud services needed. Which would include any health related data which should be in compliance with HIPAA. Or if it is any financial related organization, it should comply with Sox.",568,664,305 303 202

So therefore whenever we develop applications in cloud, it is important to keep the portability in mind because as and when new providers such as Ali cloud comes in as Google Cloud comes in there. Increasingly becoming Co popular. Oracle Cloud comes in, IBM Cloud comes in. The applications that we develop must be portable seamlessly from vendor one to vendor two Otherwise there is a high chance of vendor lock in.

The server implementation cannot guarantee the request which can be handled within some particular time interval and that is not. Possible and because of that it results in unbounded delay.

So when an application needs to access a particular file, it knows the server and the file system to. Access. The problem with this is that you are now creating a single point of failure. What if the server on which you have the centralized metadata goes down? Then your application will not be able to access the files. The second approach is. To have a distributed. Data servers wherein you have copies of this metadata available on multiple servers. The challenge with this approach is. Since you have multiple copies, you need to ensure that all the copies are current, meaning the most recent data is available in all these metadata servers. How do we ensure that? We need now we need to ensure that using what we call as distributed transactions, which we will discuss later. So these are the two general approaches. Wherein. How you access a particular file in a distributed file system? In a centralized metadata management scheme. You have one server which acts as the metadata server.",1172,1270,403 103 502
