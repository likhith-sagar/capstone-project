Distributed data and thus Apache Zookeeper is an open source distributed coordination service that helps to manage a large set of host. It actually automates the process and it is the centralized coordination service that is used by the distributed applications so that it can maintain the configuration information, perform distributed synchronization and enable group services. A party zookeeper offers a hierarchical key value store and it allows to build a reliable distributed data structures for configuration servers or a synchronization service renaming registry.

So that is election process terminates and all for all non faulty process the P is elected. Is not null that means the algorithm eventually terminates and where a leader elected among the non faulty process. So once the leader is elected, your algorithm eventually terminated right among the non faulty process. So at the end of the election protocol the non faulty process with the highest attribute or we can say best attribute. So whichever process is having highest attribute is elected as a. Leader. So highest IID process will be acting as a leader or we can say highest ID or highest address right next. So consider this example. So let us understand the classical leader election",276,364,201 304 302

So internal systems if there is a system of parallel process is running using the same clock then that is called synchronous system and an asynchronous. If each process is running on its own independent clock then that is called as asynchronous. So what does asynchronous mean in terms of process? So in computation it consists of series of steps. In each step one of the following things can happen. Either your process can send the message or your. Process can receive a message or a process performs some local computation. So if a process is about to perform a local computation and it is delayed, then it can still do that local computation irrespective of what other processes do. So as a result, it's not possible to identify which is a slow process or really if the process is slow or it is failed.

The combination of an actor, a target and a role. Role assignments are granted or revoked and may be inherited between groups and users and domains and projects. What are targets? Projects and domains are similar entities where the role is assigned on. A user or user group is given access to either a project or a domain by assigning a particular role value for that user or user group for a specific project or domain. Since projects and domains have similar characteristics, both entities can be referred to as targets. What is a token? For a user to call an open stack API, they need to prove who they are and they should be allowed to call the API in question. This is achieved by passing an open stack token into the API call.
