Again, in Blockley virtualization there are this virtualization can be done at three levels. One is at the host level, meaning at the server. Or at the storage level, that is, at the physical disk level and then at the network level. When you have multiple data sources connected, you can do it at the network level as well. In block level virtualization, as we discussed earlier, you have these physical disks and you create partitions on these disks and then you create physical volumes corresponding to these partitions and you group these physical partitions to this volume group. And then you create a logical volume on by using this volume group and then you create the file system on this logical volume. So this is at the host based virtualization,",1640,1714,202 401
