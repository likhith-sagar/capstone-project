Then we move ahead to understand the Keystone attributes,8,24,let us understand authentication in the cloud. The objectives we set out are we try to understand authentication. Then we move ahead to understand the Keystone attributes in terms of authentication. What do we mean by authentication? Authentication is an important topic in cloud computing security. The authentication process serves as a protection mechanism against different sorts of attacks. Where the goal is to confirm the identity of a user whenever a user requests services from cloud servers. What is keystone? Keystone is an open stack service,8,58,

So when there are frequent simultaneous client requests, server severely get overloaded, right? So forming traffic congestion. So when there are multiple requests from multiple clients, when those requests are pushed only to the server, definitely our server is going to get overloaded which forms a traffic congestion. That can be a drawback. So the response can be delayed right? And the next disadvantages impact of centralized architecture.

And the next one is a usage of the circuit breaker pattern. Whenever a request is given, if the error rate exceeds one particular limit then a circuit breaker is defined and which trips and this actually avoids the further failure attempts. So what happens if large number of requests are failing and in that case the service is not available, it is shared that the service is not available. So in that case if you send again and again the request then in that case it is a meaningless request. So in order to. Avoid the large number of failing requests.
