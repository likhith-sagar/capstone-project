Then we move ahead to understand the Keystone attributes,8,24,let us understand authentication in the cloud. The objectives we set out are we try to understand authentication. Then we move ahead to understand the Keystone attributes in terms of authentication. What do we mean by authentication? Authentication is an important topic in cloud computing security. The authentication process serves as a protection mechanism against different sorts of attacks. Where the goal is to confirm the identity of a user whenever a user requests services from cloud servers. What is keystone? Keystone is an open stack service,8,58,
